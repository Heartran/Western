# Western Game Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the "Western" game repository, managed by Heartran. This project is developed using Unreal Engine 4 and primarily programmed in C# and C++.

## Gameplay Objective
The main goal of the game is to collect ten keys scattered around the town and region while avoiding AI enemies that can chase and harm the player.

## Enemies
The NPC enemies employ a pursuit strategy to kill the player, deducting health points (HP) if caught in their line of sight.

## Keys
The keys are easily identifiable by an intense glow and can be found both inside buildings and around the region.

## Development
The game leverages an Unreal Engine asset with pre-existing maps and scripts, customized for key collection mechanics and AI behavior.

## Recent Activity
The latest commit involved "resource cleanup," and the main branch of the repository is not protected.
